- **One-Time View**: Links can only be viewed once (configurable)
- **Automatic Expiration**: Set an expiration time for your secrets
- **No Account Needed**: Simple and straightforward to use
- **Open Source**: Transparent and verifiable security
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
